I've added two input text files.  
One is suitable for making experiences of the solution tree's maximum depth,
and the other one contains Hungarian comments.

- `inputs\dg_gen_input_38m_11g_20240223121500.txt` is of a considerable size.
- `inputs\dg_input.txt` contains Hungarian comments. It was the original school example.

By default, this folder contains the project's input text files.

The `src\generate_input\generate_random_dg_problem.py` module generates
text files into the inputs folder also.  
These generated text files describe random produced Directed Disjunctive
Graphs suitable to serve as input (respectively input template) for
the main functionality of the project.
