By default, this folder contains the project's **input text files**.

The `src\generate_input\generate_random_dg_problem.py` module generates
text files into the `inputs` folder also.  
These generated text files describe random produced Directed Disjunctive
Graphs suitable to serve as input (respectively input template) for
the main functionality of the project.
