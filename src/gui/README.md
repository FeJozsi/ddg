# `gui` folder

Start date: 2024-03-01  
This folder contains the project's **GUI modules**.

## 2024-03-07 20:35:55 Continued developing dg_gui_finite_state_machine.py (I.)

In this latest update, we've made significant advancements in the
`dg_gui_finite_state_machine.py`
module by implementing new state management functions.

A new DgTransition class has been established. The contents of
`doc\FSM states and transfers.ods` have been meticulously mapped,
ensuring a complete representation of all GUI state transitions in the system.

## 2024-03-05 15:15:38 Added dg_gui_finite_state_machine.py module

Added the dg_gui_finite_state_machine.py module as is now.
The implementation has to be continued.

## 2024-03-04 16:48:51 Added 'FSM states and transitions.ods' spreadsheet

Added the design document `doc\FSM states and transitions.ods` to outline the
proposed FSM (Finite State Machines) states and transitions for the GUI,
pending implementation.

## 2024-03-01 16:08:44 Initialize GUI with async task simulation and file open dialog

Set up basic GUI structure for future development.
Implemented asynchronous task simulation to test async functionality.
Added file open dialog box for file selection capabilities.

## 2024-03-01 11:24:02 Set up foundational GUI elements, starting point

By default, this folder contains the project's GUI modules.

The GUI is just getting started and isn't finished yet.
We're working on making it better and easier to use.
Right now, it's like a rough draft, not the final version.
